## Onboarded without copr builds
* nss-pem

## Blocked:
### Package not found
* cockpit-container
* redminecli

### Upstream not found
* anaconda-user-help

### Source in pagure
* standard-test-roles

### multiple sources or patches in spec
* avahi
* jzlib
* ksh
* libvncserver
* openscap
* pykickstart - has invalid packit.yml right now (spec.in in specfile path)
* python-requests
* rust-pretty-git-prompt - has packit config
* system-config-printer
* yp-tools

## Needs action for spec generate:
* anaconda - how is it built?
* abrt
* libreport
* cockpit - spec parse fails
* cockpit-composer - npm fails
* rpminspect - instructions for creating .spec?
* satyr

## Other error
* expat - unclosed macro or bad line continuation
* javapackages-tools - unclosed macro or bad line continuation
* gperftools - Failed to parse SPEC file
* abrt-java-connector - The target archive doesn't use a common extension
* libevent - The target archive doesn't use a common extension

  * automation for Fedora and COPR should not depend on upstream changes
   or carrying your config file in our repositories.
  * More info: https://github.com/weldr/lorax/pull/878
* checkpolicy - https://github.com/SELinuxProject/selinux/pull/186
  * related also to **libsepol, libselinux, libsemanage, policycoreutils, secilc, mcstrans**
  * multiple components and multiple tarballs from one repository
  * the packages from the repo depend on each other (have to be taken care of/built in a specific order)
  * changes have potential to be accepted only on fedora fork
  https://github.com/fedora-selinux/selinux, changes on
  upstream need to be approved via mailing list
  * lack of trust caused by failed cooperation with other always ready project
* libguestfs collection of tools:
  * The project is using mailing lists for reviews, not GitHub pull requests
  * The request from them is that packit-service would react to branch pushes instead of PR changes
    * https://github.com/packit-service/packit-service/issues/239
  * libnbd is able to be onboarded: https://github.com/TomasTomecek/libnbd/pull/1
* Red Hat infra services team & github.com/redhat-performance
  * Some of the projects are on-board.
  * Problems:
    * ["Only collaborators can trigger packit."](https://github.com/packit-service/packit/issues/606)
    * ["More verbose packit service."](https://github.com/packit-service/packit-service/issues/243)
    * ["New Fedora release should not require projects to change packit.yaml"](https://github.com/packit-service/packit/issues/540)
* Open Source projects from [David Cantrell](https://github.com/dcantrell)
  * [Packit should take care of the complete upstream release process](https://github.com/dcantrell/pyparted/pull/66#issuecomment-555038520):
    * Create tarball, sign it and upload
  * Push to Fedora iff all CI tests pass for the respective tag.
  * Handle %changelog.
* beaker, restraint
  * multiple sources - some just need to be fetched from a remote URL
    * could be worked around with actions
  * only one tarball is from the current repo
  * using `git describe` doesn't work for them - should be turned off, we should check how tito does this
  * are using gerrit+jenkins atm (tito releasing), but want to switch to github
  * provide API for artifacts (spec, srpm, rpms) so they can be linted (rpmlint)
* dnf
  * cross-PR dependencies
    * short-term solution: enable adding a repository to the copr project via a PR comment
    * create SRPM from master branch of a dependency, if no dependency is specified
    * are using packit: 50 % of builds fail b/c of dependant projects & pull requests
  * they use a dedicated repo for tests
  * Current CI solution:
    * provisioning: container image: contains rpm builds of all the components with tests included
    * the container image is the input for the testing phase
    * they want to have a matrix with all the test cases: distribute the runs to the testing farm
  * another complete run should be then preformed with all packages built like if the PRs were merged
